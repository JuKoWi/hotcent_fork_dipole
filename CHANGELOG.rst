Development version
===================

* The GPAW-based atomic DFT calculator has been removed, as it was
  simply no longer needed (the native calculator now runs as
  fast and is easier to extend with more functionality).

* The native atomic DFT calculator has been renamed to 'AtomicDFT'
  and now resides in hotcent.atomic_dft.py
 

Version 0.9
===========

03 December 2019

* Start of versioning.
