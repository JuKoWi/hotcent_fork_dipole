    "### Multiple elements\n",

    "What if your target compounds contain more than one element, e.g. both\n",
    "silicon and oxygen? Then Step 2 (with `hotcent-basis`) will need to be repeated\n",

    "the corresponding O-specific tasks, but also with the ones that involve\n",

    "oxides (just the binary compounds, not the ternary ones) and that you would\n",
    "like to handle all the tasks in the same run for convenience or for\n",
    "better parallel efficiency (as touched upon below). Assuming that you still\n",
    "got the parameters for Si and O from the previous step, then you could\n",
    "launch the new tasks with:\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "hotcent-tables Al,O Ti,O --exclude=O --tasks=all ...\n",

    "hotcent-tables Al,Si,O --exclude=Al-O,Si-O,Al,Si,O --tasks=all ...\n",

    "folders named `tables_O-Si`, `tables_O-Si-Al` and so forth. \n",
    "For subsequent Tibi runs you will need to move their contents to a single\n",
    "directory (and also apply `hotcent-concat`), e.g.:\n",
    "\n",

    "mv tables_*/* .\n",
    "hotcent-concat -b dzp Al Si O\n",

    "### Parallelization\n",
    "\n",
    "When the workload increases due to production-quality grids or the need for\n",
    "multiple elements or GGA functionals, it will be useful to employ more\n",
    "processes than in the present `--processes=2` example. Take into account,\n",
    "though, that `hotcent-tables` can only parallelize over tasks and that the\n",
    "three-center tasks are significantly more time consuming than the other ones.\n",
    "This is also the reason why the three-center tasks are first ones to be\n",
    "processed, as it helps with the load balancing / parallel efficiency.\n",
    "`hotcent-tables` furthermore uses the [multiprocessing module](\n",
    "https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html) for parallelization,\n",
    "which means that it will not be able to spawn processes across multiple nodes."
